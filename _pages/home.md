Hi! I am Ayman! Welcome to my webpage! Here is a bit of information about me if you're curious :) 

I am a second year PhD student in the [Mathematic for Real-World Systems CDT](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/mathsys/) at the University of Warwick, where I am supervise by [Dr Rich Savage](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/zeeman_institute/staffv2/savage). Although, I am currently based in London at the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/) as an enrichment student. My main area of research is in Machine Learning and its applications in healthcare. I am work on developing methodolgies for transfer learning and multitask learning for Gaussian Process models (of the shallow and deep varieties!). I am also interested in probabilistic modelling in general and scaling its applications through Variational Inference.

## Research Interests:
* Gaussian Processes
* Multitask and Transfer Learning
* Bayesian Inference (mainly Variational Inference)
* Probabilistic Modelling
* Representation Learning
